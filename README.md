# Script-for-exploiting-Blind-SQL-injection
This is a bash script made for automating the exploitation of Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

An example will be:

```
bash blind3.sh 20 "Select user()"
```

Where 20 is maximum of characters we expect from the response and what inside the quotes is the query that you want to do.

**HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE THE QUERY "@@version" TO SEE WHICH IS THE DATABASE VERSION TO SEND THE APPROPIATE QUERYS.

You can use a query cheatsheet like the ones that are in the PentestMonkey webpage.
