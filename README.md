# Script-for-exploiting-Blind-SQL-injection
This is a bash script made for automating the exploitation of Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

<h3>HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE THE QUERY "@@version" TO SEE WHICH IS THE DATABASE VERSION TO SEND THE APPROPIATE QUERYS</h3>

CHANGE THE URL ON THE 5th line for the one that you want to use

CHANGE THE ?band=the offspring' of the 20th line for "? the vulnerable parameter=Xvalue' "

An example will be:

```
bash blind3.sh 20 "Select user()"
bash blind3.sh 20 "Select database()"
```

Where 20 is maximum of characters we expect from the response and what's inside the quotes is the query that you want to do.



You can use a query cheatsheet like the ones that are in the PentestMonkey webpage.
